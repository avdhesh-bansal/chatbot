Warm / cold water works perfect and quick\r\nCONS:\r\n- Room is not so spacious, 4 suitcases or 2 big ones may be hard to fit in the room.\r\n- Wardrobe almost unusable.\r\n- Whole apartment and bedroom not as clean as you would expect.\r\n- Dishes and glasses too many times dirty or in dishwaher.\r\n- FULL of dog hair, on the floor, food and bathroom anytime. Even if you like dogs, will find it disgusting.\r\n- AC in room is OK but really noisy. Dining room in summer is not less than a sauna.\r\n- 4th floor without elevator. The block makes you think you are living in Bronx instead Brooklyn.\r\n- Our host (Paul) was not so talkative and cool as we expected. You will have longer conversations even with strangers in the subway.\r\n- Quiet street, no traffic, but building under construction just in front our window meant noise and workers shouting every day from 7:30 AM.\r\nRECCOMENDED FOR:\r\n-Affordable price appartment, well located, near shops, restaurants and subway (15-20 min to Manhattan)\r\nNOT RECCOMENDED FOR:\r\n- those who are allergic to pets or don't like dogs, guests who wish to improve english / share experiences with a newyorker guy.", "reviewer_name": "Jordi", "listing_longitude": "-73.98937115554887", "host_name": "Paul", "listing_name": "Spacious room in cozy Boerum Hill", "date": "2013-08-10", "host_id": "2495797", "id": "6369497", "listing_latitude": "40.686986552490545"}
