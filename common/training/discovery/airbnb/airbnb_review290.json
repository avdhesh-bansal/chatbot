{"listing_id": "506306", "reviewer_id": "4023029", "text": "Paul was an excellent host. The room was as advertised and the apartment clean, tidy and nice. Clean sheets and towels were freely provided and Paul was eager to help if there was anything I needed. I also really liked his endearing dog, Nigel. The apartment is also really close to a lot of great places to eat and drink, and the subway is only two blocks away. Paul had some recommendations for places to eat in Brooklyn and they were spot on for my tastes. I particularily recommend checking out Bare Burger for eating and Bar Great Harry to sample some nice beers.", "reviewer_name": "Helge", "listing_longitude": "-73.98937115554887", "host_name": "Paul", "listing_name": "Spacious room in cozy Boerum Hill", "date": "2014-07-22", "host_id": "2495797", "id": "16184493", "listing_latitude": "40.686986552490545"}
