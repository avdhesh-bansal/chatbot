Alesandra was easy to talk to and had great suggestions for restaurants in the area. She was very easy to get ahold of if I needed anything. I felt right at home in her apartment. I've traveled alone a lot and I really felt safe in the apartment and in the neighborhood when I was walking alone, even at night. I would definitely recommend Alesandra as a host and hope to stay again if I return to NYC.
