There is also a cable TV.\r\nonly one minor point for improvement - since it is Dominic's place, the closet was full with his things and we had only a very small space to put our stuff. Other than that it was perfect.\r\nThe apartment is on the fourth floor, with an elevator.\r\nDominic is really nice and responsive, and provided us with a list of recommendations. \r\nWe highly recommend staying in this beautiful apartment!
