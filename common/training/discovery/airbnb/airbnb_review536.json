Close to the subway and supermarket as well great shopping only a couple of streets away. Apartment was very clean and had everything we required and although it looked exactly as in the photos was quite old and patched up very poorly. We arrived on a hot day and it took 2 days for the apartment to cool down. The airconditioning was close to useless. The fridge did not keep our drinks cold and the bed in the main room was only a double and the springs squeaked every time you moved. Curtains did not darken the rooms and the sheets and towels were of very poor quality.
