As read in the rest of the reviews, the location is great. About a 10 minute walk away from Central park, the Met Museum and the metro station. \r\n\r\nWe were surprised to have another guest staying in the second bedroom. (We thought there was only this bedroom which was listed). \r\nShortly after the 1st guest departed another 2 people arrived. \r\n\r\nThis room isn't necessarily private, as there is a make-shift wall 2.5 feet away from the ceiling created to section off the living room. The air conditioning is lost once in the lofted bed since obviously heat rises. Overall, we were happy with our stay and it's ultimately what we needed for two night in NY.
