It was also comfortable, cool (in temperature), convenient and quiet.\r\nSahr was a gracious, thoughtful and a very hospitable hostess that went the extra mile to ensure that our stay was pleasurable.  The location was very convenient and met our needs; there was an abundance of parking spots steps away from her front door.  \r\nWe would recommend this Charming one bedroom studio to anyone considering it!", "reviewer_name": "Liz", "listing_longitude": "-73.9654244911215", "host_name": "Sahr", "listing_name": "The Brooklyn Waverly, One Bedroom", "date": "2011-07-19", "host_id": "116599", "id": "383597", "listing_latitude": "40.684129016333486"}
