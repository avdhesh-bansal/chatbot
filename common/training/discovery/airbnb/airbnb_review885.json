But once you get in the apartment its great. Air condition, Wifi, fairly big bathroom (bath tub), and a small but complete kitchen are among the many high points.\r\n\r\nThe apartment is located literally at the brink of the hippest parts of East Village. You wanna get a typical New York breakfast? Check! You want to grab a local draft beer at an uber cool bar? Check! You wanna hear live music played by Grateful Deads long lost twins? Check! You want to go to a flea market?! Check!\r\n\r\nThe \"L\" subway line is located around 120 yards from the apartment, and if you want to go to eg Times Square, get on it (it is very safe) and change two stations away on Union Square.\r\n\r\nI can't say enough about how great apartment this is. The location is just awesome.\r\n\r\nCasper is the best possible host.\r\n\r\nThis is a real gem. I highly recommend it to anyone serious about exploring and experiencing Manhattan.
