Certain positive and negative aspects have to be mentioned.\r\n\r\nPOSITIVE: The neighborhood was very nice. There are a lot of bars and restaurants where you can go to. The subway station is reachable in 5 minutes. Eugene is very nice and he gave us some tips what we can do.\r\n\r\nNEGATIVE: Unfortunately the bathroom was not clean. There was a lot of mold on the shower curtain which was very uncomfortable for us. Further you have to be fast while taking a shower because the water doesnt flow off which is very disgusting since the tub is not clean. We really were disappointed of the cleanliness in the bathrooom. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION: Consequently we would only recommend staying at the apartment to people who dont really care about cleanliness. Since this is a very important issue to us we would not stay again.", "reviewer_name": "Michel", "listing_longitude": "-73.95457505681182", "host_name": "Yevgeny", "listing_name": "Amazing Upper East Side Location", "date": "2015-05-30", "host_id": "19331457", "id": "33605214", "listing_latitude": "40.77632479255753"}
