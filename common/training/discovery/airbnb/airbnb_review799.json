The place is not luxurious, but for $50 per night you get a comfortable bed in your own large room.  The location is great - about a 10 minute walk to Central Park, 15 minutes to Times Square and only 5+ minutes to the E subway at 50th street.  Great value.", "reviewer_name": "Todd", "listing_longitude": "-73.98947031812058", "host_name": "Eric", "listing_name": "Best Deal in Hell's Kitchen!!", "date": "2012-11-16", "host_id": "3747161", "id": "2897138", "listing_latitude": "40.76294784145624"}
