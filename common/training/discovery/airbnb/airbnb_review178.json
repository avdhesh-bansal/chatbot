She was very accommodating with our arrival and departing schedule.  The apartment is located in a quiet, and safe area.  It is close to the subway station, and also close to Central Park.  The UWS has some very yummy places to eat, and also some cool pubs.  Maegan recommended some yummy places. There is no elevator, so be prepared to carry your bags upstairs. It's NYC....walking, and climbing upstairs is part of the \"Big City\" experience.  We would stay again, and recommend it to others! Thank you Maegan!!", "reviewer_name": "Sandy", "listing_longitude": "-73.97605674795899", "host_name": "Maegan", "listing_name": "UWS apt close to Central Park!", "date": "2013-04-05", "host_id": "568645", "id": "4042503", "listing_latitude": "40.78240559601185"}
