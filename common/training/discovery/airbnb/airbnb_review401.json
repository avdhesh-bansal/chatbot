Normally we stay at hotels but because New York is expensive and we also wanted to stay near the locals we decided to stay at an airbnb site.\n\nWe were welcomed by Yoki when we arrived at macon street. It's very easy to get there by metro. If you are travelling from JFK, its the airtrain to howard beach and then the A line to Nostrand Avenue. Travelling time is around 35min.\n\nYoki had everything prepared and showed us the beds, kitchen and bathroom. We can say that everything was very nice and the price compared to what you get is great. \n\nFuthermore Yoki's place is in brooklyn and its not on the main street so you don't have traffic noises like in manhatten. Brooklyn itself is already a great place to stay. It's also alot cheaper than manhattan and has great restaurant. Its worth a visit.\n\nTo sum all things up: Yoki's place is a great place to stay and you don't needto pay double to price to stay in Manhattan. Bedford-Stuyvesant (area) has good breakfast and lunch, supermarkets and the metro is around the corner and in 20minutes you' re in Manhattan.\n\nThank you Yoki!\n\nZipora and Carl", "reviewer_name": "Zipora", "listing_longitude": "-73.94839340169014", "host_name": "Yoki", "listing_name": "Family Owned & Operated Brownstone", "date": "2014-05-22", "host_id": "6294856", "id": "13209510", "listing_latitude": "40.680181359197405"}
