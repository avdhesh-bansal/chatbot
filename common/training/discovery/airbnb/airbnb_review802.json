My arrival at JFK was delayed by over 2 hrs due to very long checkout at the customs line. Eric was also a very patient & responsive in communication during my whole stay in his place as he waited for me to arrive that night to hand me a set of keys to his apartment. The apartment was really basic but enough for everything you need. The bed was very comfortable & I also really enjoyed the all the very subtle atmospheric sounds of cars, taxi horns, police, ambulance coming from the street traffic. Really feels like I was living like a true New Yorker. The location was really safe & amazing, right next to a 24hr deli / convenience store, banks, cafes, restaurants, all kinds of shops & a bicycle shop across the street where they also rent out some of their bicycles, so I rented out a cheap but good bicycle to get around during my whole stay in NY. The apartment was also really close to Central Park, MOMA, & Times Square. Overall, I really enjoyed my stay there & would stay there again in the future.", "reviewer_name": "Danny", "listing_longitude": "-73.98947031812058", "host_name": "Eric", "listing_name": "Best Deal in Hell's Kitchen!!", "date": "2012-12-01", "host_id": "3747161", "id": "3003915", "listing_latitude": "40.76294784145624"}
