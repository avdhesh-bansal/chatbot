{"listing_id": "110762", "reviewer_id": "2462194", "text": "I only stayed for one night. Maegan organized everything perfectly. So I met a friend of hers to get the keys. The neighborhood is one of Manhattan's nicest and has tons of bars and restaurants to go to. I really loved the apartment, it even has access to the roof terrace which especially during summer can be important. The apartment was very clean, Maegan provided me with two clean towels, soap and shampoo. I can definitely recommend renting this apartment to everyone!
