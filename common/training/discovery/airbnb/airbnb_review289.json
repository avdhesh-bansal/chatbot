He gave us helpful information about places to go, and we had even a wonderful afternoon watching the final match of the soccer world championship on TV. \r\nThe apartment is centrally located in Brooklyn with many shops, caf\u00e9s and restaurants around and an easy connection to Manhattan. A very nice apartment, clean and well equipped - everything perfect. We strongly recommend Paul to everybody going to NYC. Thank you very much!", "reviewer_name": "Ingmar", "listing_longitude": "-73.98937115554887", "host_name": "Paul", "listing_name": "Spacious room in cozy Boerum Hill", "date": "2014-07-18", "host_id": "2495797", "id": "15916483", "listing_latitude": "40.686986552490545"}
