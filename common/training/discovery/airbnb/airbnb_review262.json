He has a dog which is very tame and like Paul friendly. The building is a short walk to the subway, downtown Brooklyn, Tkts booth (you can walk or take the subway 1 stop) banks/atms, food stores, restaurants, and other services. He charges a fair price for his location. I highly recommend him.", "reviewer_name": "Ken", "listing_longitude": "-73.98937115554887", "host_name": "Paul", "listing_name": "Spacious room in cozy Boerum Hill", "date": "2013-07-24", "host_id": "2495797", "id": "5968681", "listing_latitude": "40.686986552490545"}
