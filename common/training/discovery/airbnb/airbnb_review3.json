{"listing_id": "7652181", "reviewer_id": "24166824", "text": "Felix was really a great host. The apartment is cool and relaxing inside, and the neighborhood is really the best place to be in Brooklyn, easy train access to Manhattan and a friendly, vibrant corner of Brooklyn, with lots to do on foot, just steps from the apartment. I had some great conversations with Felix, and with his friend that was visiting, just returned from working abroad. I would recommend Felix's place for any visit to NYC, either as a domestic traveler or international.
