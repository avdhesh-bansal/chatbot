Checkin and checkout was super easy, and Dom was more than accommodating of our plans.\r\nHis place in SoHo is great; clean, quite and the perfect size for 2 people! It is situated in a great area of SoHo - away from the more crowded streets but close to many wonderful neighbourhood restaurants and shops.\r\nI would definitely recommend his place to any friends and family visiting New York without hesitation.", "reviewer_name": "Tessa", "listing_longitude": "-74.00306669619759", "host_name": "Dom", "listing_name": "Quiet Studio in Prime SoHo", "date": "2014-10-15", "host_id": "1408973", "id": "21365707", "listing_latitude": "40.72492733670143"}
