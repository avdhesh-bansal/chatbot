You will also like Nigel, his gray dog which is no disturbance at all.\r\n\r\nPaul was so kind to lend me his city bike card, and I very much enjoyed biking around Brooklyn Heights and downtown Manhatten (watch out - no bike stations further uptown than Central Park). If you prefer public transportation, subway stations on Jay street and Hoyt street are just a 5 minutes walk away.\r\n\r\nPaul's appartement is not big, but my bedroom was as spacious as it appears on the foto and surprisingly quiet, going to the street. It is on the 4th floor, without elevator. Admittedly, the staircase of the building looks a bit shabby but the neighborhood is absolutely safe. Nice restaurants and coffee shops right around the corner on Smith street - I recommend Konditori for breakfast with free Wifi and the Bar Tabac, a kind of french bistro, for a light dinner. The sauvignon was good. I really enjoyed my stay in Brooklyn which is less expensive and uppish than Manhatten.", "reviewer_name": "Michael", "listing_longitude": "-73.98937115554887", "host_name": "Paul", "listing_name": "Spacious room in cozy Boerum Hill", "date": "2014-06-24", "host_id": "2495797", "id": "14700054", "listing_latitude": "40.686986552490545"}
