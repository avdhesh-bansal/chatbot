He was very flexible with letting me keep my bags in the apartment after check out, had lots of recommendations about places in the neighborhood -- even told me about a David Sedaris book reading after noticing I was reading a David Sedaris book. His dog Nigel is nice once he gets to know you, but will bark at you at first. \r\n\r\nThe apartment was really nice, spacious, and pretty much exactly as he described on the listing. The neighborhood is great and very accessible via public transit. There are tons of restaurants, shops, bars in the 'hood. \r\n", "reviewer_name": "Monica", "listing_longitude": "-73.98937115554887", "host_name": "Paul", "listing_name": "Spacious room in cozy Boerum Hill", "date": "2014-06-04", "host_id": "2495797", "id": "13804656", "listing_latitude": "40.686986552490545"}
