However he was quick to respond to messages and everything was arranged for my arrival.\r\n\r\nAdam's house mates Hunter and Jon were extremely welcoming and friendly. I felt at ease sharing the apartment with them and enjoyed spending evenings with them.\r\n\r\nI would wholeheartedly recommend this room for any prospective Airbnb guests.", "reviewer_name": "Daniel", "listing_longitude": "-73.94437651493752", "host_name": "Adam", "listing_name": "~*Awesome Room in LIC w/ backyard*~", "date": "2015-06-01", "host_id": "28846474", "id": "33828343", "listing_latitude": "40.74770393390215"}
