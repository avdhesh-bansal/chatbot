{"listing_id": "1356494", "reviewer_id": "34038696", "text": "Although the room is advertised, it is important to note that 1) the room is facing the street, which is very load and there are live music performances on the ground floor of the same building every Monday & Wednesday, so it is impossible to sleep; 2) the apartment and room were not cleaned upon my arrival and the bathroom was clean only one week out of 4 of my stay; and 3) the host was not professional when I raised the issues about the noise level. So overall it was a very bad experience.
