The apartment was very clean and looked just like the pictures. Before our arrival William always responden to our questions very quickly, which was greatly appreciated. The location is perfect, with a five block walk and a 7 minute subway ride you find yourself in downtown manhattan. We couldn't have asked for more. There is a grocery store just a cross the street and there are some takeout places close by for the days you just want to stay in. Overall a great experience!", "reviewer_name": "Joakim", "listing_longitude": "-73.9409468848735", "host_name": "Will", "listing_name": "Your Stunning Vacation Apartment!", "date": "2011-11-01", "host_id": "127772", "id": "678411", "listing_latitude": "40.818218466557525"}
