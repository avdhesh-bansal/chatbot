Due to this we actually did not see Paul very often: we left the flat in the morning and came back home very late. But Paul was a nice host. He prepared an informative leaflet with helpful Information.\r\nThe neighbourhood is good with everything we needed nearby: the Metro stations and a lovely cafe for a coffee before a New York City day.\r\nAll in all: we highly recommend Paul and his room!", "reviewer_name": "Katharina", "listing_longitude": "-73.98937115554887", "host_name": "Paul", "listing_name": "Spacious room in cozy Boerum Hill", "date": "2014-06-13", "host_id": "2495797", "id": "14163046", "listing_latitude": "40.686986552490545"}
