It was never more than a few minute before he got back to me if I had a question. The room was very spacious, clean, and organized. Exactly as the photos look! \r\nThis was my first 'airbnb' stay and also my first time in the city, and taking those two factors in account, I could not have asked for a better place to stay! Highly recommended!
