We were arriving by bus from DC and ended up being a little later than we'd expected to but she was graciously flexible with our arrival time and gave us great directions on how to best get to her. When we finally arrived, she explained the house rules and gave us tips for getting around based on our itinerary. Aside from that, we didn't see her much but she was always a text away for any questions we had! I've already recommended her to my friends that are planning to visit NYC soon, and I'd totally stay here again -- the location is great (Spanish Harlem) with lots of culture but not much noise, and we were about 2 blocks from the nearest subway stop and 3 blocks from Central Park. Definitely a great place to stay if you're looking to really feel like you're part of NYC!", "reviewer_name": "Christa", "listing_longitude": "-73.94482017016313", "host_name": "Alesandra", "listing_name": "Low Winter Price by Central Park!", "date": "2015-04-13", "host_id": "15185319", "id": "29872546", "listing_latitude": "40.79285153420157"}
