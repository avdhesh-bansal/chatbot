Achilles was very quick to respond and was always available if I had any questions about the city. The room was clean and big and could be locked. I had a lot of privacy. Big bed, very comfy. The apartment was very well located, 5-min walk to the subway and in a safe neighborhood. I would recommend it anytime!", "reviewer_name": "Catherine", "listing_longitude": "-73.91081184967771", "host_name": "Achilles", "listing_name": "Just 15 Minutes to Midtown !!", "date": "2015-06-28", "host_id": "10606396", "id": "36484459", "listing_latitude": "40.77673184578338"}
