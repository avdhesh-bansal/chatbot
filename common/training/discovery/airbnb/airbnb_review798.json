{"listing_id": "724806", "reviewer_id": "3750467", "text": "Hurricane Sandy threw me and my girlfriend a wild card when it decided to roll through during the final days of our vacation - forcing us to cancel our stay in the Upper West Side arranged through Airbnb and keep safe at a friends place in Brooklyn. After the storm settled, we were notified our flight was rescheduled for the following Saturday, granting us more time to stay in NYC. We were scrambling to find an affordable place to stay in Manhattan, and just when we thought we would not be able to find a place Eric offered his room for an extremely affordable rate considering the location and circumstance. My girlfriend and I were extremely grateful - Eric has a warm, comfy room in an apartment that is exactly what I would expect in Hell's Kitchen (an old tenement walk up). Bonus points for the extremely cute turtle who we were not required to take care of during our stay, but would have been happy to anyway. The location is ideal - lots of great food in the area and a nice stroll away from Times Square and the park. Eric was a gracious host who was quick to respond to any and all inquiries. Overall and ideal spot for a young individual or couple to stay.", "reviewer_name": "Daniel", "listing_longitude": "-73.98947031812058", "host_name": "Eric", "listing_name": "Best Deal in Hell's Kitchen!!", "date": "2012-11-04", "host_id": "3747161", "id": "2804479", "listing_latitude": "40.76294784145624"}
