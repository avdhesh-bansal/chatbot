He was a great host and full of intelligent conversation.  Wish that I had a few more nights at his place!  \r\n\r\nPaul's apartment is beautiful, clean, and comfortable.  Conveniently located a short couple blocks from the subway, it makes it super easy to get into Manhattan.  Though, it's in a great neighborhood with plenty to do so you may not need to.  I felt at home in his apartment and I'm missing his dog Nigel already!", "reviewer_name": "Anthony", "listing_longitude": "-73.98937115554887", "host_name": "Paul", "listing_name": "Spacious room in cozy Boerum Hill", "date": "2013-04-05", "host_id": "2495797", "id": "4047165", "listing_latitude": "40.686986552490545"}
