Every morning she made coffee, and there was always fruit and snacks available. She also had some great recommendations for restaurants, one of which I went to every single day of my stay.\r\n\r\nThe neighborhood was amazing, with every possible south and east Asian food you'd ever want within walking distance. There is a transit station about 2 blocks away that has multiple trains coming in. It was so easy to get around from that station! Plus, there is a direct bus to/from Laguardia, so there are no stops and only takes about 10 minutes. It was perfect!\r\n\r\nThe building is a prewar building, and the apartment hasn't had many updates over the years, but that was exactly what I was expecting. It was homey, and gave a true sense of living in Queens. If you're the type who expects perfection, this probably isn't the place for you as it does have some quirks. If you want a true NY experience, in a clean and comfortable apartment with a great host, and a great price, book now!!", "reviewer_name": "Amanda", "listing_longitude": "-73.89170846185088", "host_name": "Paula", "listing_name": "Cozy private room in Queens NY", "date": "2015-10-07", "host_id": "45464080", "id": "49948900", "listing_latitude": "40.75167299269108"}
