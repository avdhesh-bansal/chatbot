It is very convenient for getting up early to get rush tickets at the theatres around Times Square or Lincoln centre and has a wide choice of good restaurants on 9th avenue.  The room and bathroom were clean. Eric provided good communication for arranging to collect the keys etc.", "reviewer_name": "Neil", "listing_longitude": "-73.98947031812058", "host_name": "Eric", "listing_name": "Best Deal in Hell's Kitchen!!", "date": "2014-06-02", "host_id": "3747161", "id": "13678939", "listing_latitude": "40.76294784145624"}
