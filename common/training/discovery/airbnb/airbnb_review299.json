He was prepared with a little \u201cwelcome packet\" of info (where to find things, keys, WiFi info, etc.), and was really great to talk to.\r\n\r\nLocation wise, the apartment is right in the middle of Boreum Hill with easy access to \u2014 well \u2014 everything. It was easy to get in and out when you needed to. An absolutely perfect spot.\r\n\r\nAnd last but not least: parking. Most people visiting Brooklyn might be flying in, etc., but I drove up from Baltimore. Luckily, there was a garage literally a block away and I only paid ~$50 for 3 days. Amazing.\r\n\r\nHighly recommended.", "reviewer_name": "Ian", "listing_longitude": "-73.98937115554887", "host_name": "Paul", "listing_name": "Spacious room in cozy Boerum Hill", "date": "2014-10-12", "host_id": "2495797", "id": "21130897", "listing_latitude": "40.686986552490545"}
