She really went out of the way to make our stay memorable and safe in the big city.\r\n\r\nFor the price and location, our accommodations at Alessandra's impeccable home was very much appreciated, along with her helpful tips on sights and transportation around the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nI would highly recommend Alessandra's place to anyone visiting NYC, especially if they would need a truly comfortable, safe, clean, and stylish \"home away from home\" on their travels. I'm definitely going to book this place on my next trip to The City! Big thanks to Alessandra!", "reviewer_name": "Lilac", "listing_longitude": "-73.94482017016313", "host_name": "Alesandra", "listing_name": "Low Winter Price by Central Park!", "date": "2015-11-29", "host_id": "15185319", "id": "55216894", "listing_latitude": "40.79285153420157"}
