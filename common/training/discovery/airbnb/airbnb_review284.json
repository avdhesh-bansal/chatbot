His apartment was perfectly located for me to explore Brooklyn, near enough to an organic grocery store, and close to the subways to get anywhere else. The bed was comfortable and the kitchen well-equipped.\r\n\r\nPaul was a great host who asked what I needed and provided it. We had good conversations about technology and politics, and I really felt like part of a home. I even attended a concert hosted by Paul and met some new friends!\r\n\r\nNigel, the dog, is a lovely soul who greeted me at the door (first with barks and later with tail-wags) and rolled over for belly-rubs. He loves Cheerios. I loved the opportunity to have a pet for a month. \r\n\r\nAll in all, this was a great stay and I recommend Paul's place for a laid-back, friendly, engaging experience in New York.", "reviewer_name": "Stephanie", "listing_longitude": "-73.98937115554887", "host_name": "Paul", "listing_name": "Spacious room in cozy Boerum Hill", "date": "2014-06-01", "host_id": "2495797", "id": "13605291", "listing_latitude": "40.686986552490545"}
