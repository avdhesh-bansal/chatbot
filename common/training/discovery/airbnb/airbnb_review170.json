It's really quite close to everything including the subway. \r\nWe felt quite comfortable there and enjoyed our stay even though it was only for the weekend. Only the Wi-Fi connection wasn't so good.\r\nAll in all the apartment was exactly what Maegan (and the pictures) promised and we can only recommend a stay there. \r\nMaegan is really nice, a lovely host and very helpful.", "reviewer_name": "Katrin", "listing_longitude": "-73.97605674795899", "host_name": "Maegan", "listing_name": "UWS apt close to Central Park!", "date": "2012-05-08", "host_id": "568645", "id": "1246793", "listing_latitude": "40.78240559601185"}
