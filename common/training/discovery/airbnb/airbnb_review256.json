It is super nice, conveniently located between several subway stops and the neighborhood is amazing. Paul was a very good host - although he wasn't there, he organized a friend to let us in and we could get into the apartment without any problems. He had prepared a little manual so we found ourselves at home right away. We would have loved to stay longer and definitely recommend him as a host. A big THANK YOU to Paul!", "reviewer_name": "Julia", "listing_longitude": "-73.98937115554887", "host_name": "Paul", "listing_name": "Spacious room in cozy Boerum Hill", "date": "2013-06-23", "host_id": "2495797", "id": "5291942", "listing_latitude": "40.686986552490545"}
