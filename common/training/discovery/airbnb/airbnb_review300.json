The room is exactly like what you see in the pictures and the space is fine for a couple or somebody travelling alone. Nigel, Paul's dog, is very nice and gentle even though he barks when you come home. There are plenty of different metro lines around too, so it gets easy to go wherever you wanna go to manhattan.
