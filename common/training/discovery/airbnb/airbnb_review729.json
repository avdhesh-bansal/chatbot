The only thing that should be mentioned in the description is, that our room didn't have a wall all the way up to the ceiling, there is a gap of aprox. 2 feet in between. Gene was a very helpful host and did everything to make our stay great. He stopped by a few times, had great advices and is really nice to chat with. We can highly recommend staying at Genes Apartments", "reviewer_name": "Michael", "listing_longitude": "-73.95457505681182", "host_name": "Yevgeny", "listing_name": "Amazing Upper East Side Location", "date": "2016-01-09", "host_id": "19331457", "id": "59301263", "listing_latitude": "40.77632479255753"}
