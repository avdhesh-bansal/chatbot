My only regret is that I did not book this place for my entire stay while in NY.  Eleonora was quick to respond to any questions and was very accommodating. I would definitely stay here again and highly recommend it.", "reviewer_name": "Rachel", "listing_longitude": "-73.9518603768407", "host_name": "Eleonora", "listing_name": "Best spot,central,cozy,last minute!", "date": "2015-11-23", "host_id": "3142063", "id": "54782555", "listing_latitude": "40.78601471607196"}
