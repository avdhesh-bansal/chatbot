I lived two blocks from his place for most of my adult life, so being able to return for work to an clean, well-appointed, classic apartment in my neighborhood was a true pleasure--i'll hope to be able to stay there again in the future! i would add (though i hope that doesn't make it change)-- it's a very good price: there's almost nowhere in manhattan more convenient to literally everything you need--whatever you do or like--than around union square.
