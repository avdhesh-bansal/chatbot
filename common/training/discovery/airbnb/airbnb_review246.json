His apartment is clean, homey and located near the subway. The bed was comfortable and everything very neat. No elevator so be prepared to climb the stairs. The dog, Nigel, at first barked and then overcame his suspicions and let us rub his tummy. I  enjoyed staying with Paul in his corner of Brooklyn. I would recommend him to other visitors in Boerum Hill.", "reviewer_name": "Margaret", "listing_longitude": "-73.98937115554887", "host_name": "Paul", "listing_name": "Spacious room in cozy Boerum Hill", "date": "2013-04-08", "host_id": "2495797", "id": "4075862", "listing_latitude": "40.686986552490545"}
