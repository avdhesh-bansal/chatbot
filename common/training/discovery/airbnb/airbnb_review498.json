{"listing_id": "115678", "reviewer_id": "5599796", "text": "This apartment is old, as are almost all of the apartments in Harlem but it is very clean and had everything I needed (except for a coffee pot which I never found).  Anyone unfamiliar with Harlem brownstones should know that most apartments are located on the second or third floor, up several flights of steep stairs so pack lightly.  Also, brownstones are not air conditioned although there was one window air conditioner in the living room (but the sofa blocked a lot of the air).  I never met William but a woman identified herself as his mother and met me and showed me the apartment and gave me the keys.  The street is very quiet and was just what I needed.", "reviewer_name": "Priscilla", "listing_longitude": "-73.9409468848735", "host_name": "Will", "listing_name": "Your Stunning Vacation Apartment!", "date": "2013-06-22", "host_id": "127772", "id": "5273675", "listing_latitude": "40.818218466557525"}
