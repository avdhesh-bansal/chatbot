Achilles is such a nice, easygoing and helpful host! The apartment is cosy, clean, quiet and in a very nice area, close to everything you need and only a few subway stops away from Manhattan. I would definitely recommend it very highly to everyone visiting New York and hope to stay there again the next time I come to New York!", "reviewer_name": "Ineke", "listing_longitude": "-73.91081184967771", "host_name": "Achilles", "listing_name": "Just 15 Minutes to Midtown !!", "date": "2015-10-09", "host_id": "10606396", "id": "50062254", "listing_latitude": "40.77673184578338"}
