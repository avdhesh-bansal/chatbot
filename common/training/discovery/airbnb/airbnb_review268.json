He was great both in making me feel comfortable in the apartment, and in helping out with whatever needs I had in terms of finding my way around, suggestions, etc. The flat felt very homelike, was absolutely clean, and as described. Thanks to talking to Paul, and to his great map, I had no problem in immediately finding excellent places for breakfast and dinner, just around the corner. The location in terms of transport and distance to Manhattan made moving around so easy. I highly recommend this flat.\r\nP.S. Nigel is a lovely dog, by the way.\r\n", "reviewer_name": "Rui", "listing_longitude": "-73.98937115554887", "host_name": "Paul", "listing_name": "Spacious room in cozy Boerum Hill", "date": "2013-09-21", "host_id": "2495797", "id": "7454424", "listing_latitude": "40.686986552490545"}
