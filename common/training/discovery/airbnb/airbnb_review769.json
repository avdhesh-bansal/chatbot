Upside features includes a very comfy bed, aircon and TV with good selection of channels.\r\n\r\nOn the downside, the apartment's storage areas were full and it wasn't possible to place our clothes in the cupboards or hang shirts. also, some of the owner's personal items, such as bathroom toiletries, were not stored away.\r\n\r\nThe stay was generally quite good and based on the location and amenities we would recommend a stay.", "reviewer_name": "Stefan", "listing_longitude": "-74.00306669619759", "host_name": "Dom", "listing_name": "Quiet Studio in Prime SoHo", "date": "2013-06-13", "host_id": "1408973", "id": "5120288", "listing_latitude": "40.72492733670143"}
