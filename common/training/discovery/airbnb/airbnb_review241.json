Nigel is a really nice fellow and it was fun walking him around Brooklyn. Paul gave a nice tour around. It\u00b4s just a short jump down to Brooklyn Bridge Park, which is really pretty especially at dusk. We can only recommend staying with Paul, we\u00b4ll be back as well :-)", "reviewer_name": "Katja", "listing_longitude": "-73.98937115554887", "host_name": "Paul", "listing_name": "Spacious room in cozy Boerum Hill", "date": "2012-10-18", "host_id": "2495797", "id": "2649460", "listing_latitude": "40.686986552490545"}
