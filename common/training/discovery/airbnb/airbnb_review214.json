I strongly recommend anyone thinking of staying in Astoria/Queens to stay here. I stayed in the apartment for 5 days coming from Greece. I found the neighbourhood safe, vibrant and very friendly. The apartment is in a great location close to all amenities such as shops cafes and transport. Also Beverly will make you feel at home as hi is a very good communicator from the moment you get in touch with him making things a very easy process. Thanks again Achilles for being a wonderful host. \u03a7\u03a7\u03a7", "reviewer_name": "Spiros", "listing_longitude": "-73.91081184967771", "host_name": "Achilles", "listing_name": "Just 15 Minutes to Midtown !!", "date": "2015-10-19", "host_id": "10606396", "id": "51347173", "listing_latitude": "40.77673184578338"}
