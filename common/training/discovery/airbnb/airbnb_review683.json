Although we didn't actually meet Eugene, he was incredibly flexible with check-in times and arranged for keys to be available when we arrived at 2:00am. \n\nThe only negative aspect of our stay is that the room we rented did not have a wall that reached the ceiling (it was about 2 feet short) and didn't really have a door. As there were other guests in the other room and the bed was set up as a loft bed which overlooked the lounge, we really didn't have a lot of privacy. This is something we would have liked to know about up front.
